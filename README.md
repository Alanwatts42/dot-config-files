# vimrc
My .vimrc file, which gives Vim some features of a Python IDE. 

The features that this .vimrc adds to Vim are:

1. Vundle - a system for managing plugins. It searches and downloads new
   plugins automatically as they are listed in the .vimrc file.

2. Vim-fugitive - Git wrapper for VIM. <a

3. Sparkup - HTML coding app. Lets you compose long blocks of HTML using a much
   'short-hand' coding language similar to CSS which automatically expands the
   shorter code into full-length HTML. 

4. NERDTree Tabs - Tab plugin for Vim. https://github.com/jistr/vim-nerdtree-tabs
